Building a package for Ubuntu
-
Make sure that you have the following in the deployment file (to avoid errors about copying qml directory)

targetFullPath = $$target$$last(sourcePathSegments)

Move to source directory and create package.

debuild -I.git -Iandroid -Iimages/promotional

Install and test package. If all is OK, make source package:

debuild -I.git -Iandroid -Iimages/promotional -S

Upload using dput

dput ppa:<yourppa>/nanoparticles ../nanoparticles_2.0.0_source.changes
